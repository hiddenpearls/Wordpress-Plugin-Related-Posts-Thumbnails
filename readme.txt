== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin decide which image to use as post thumbnail? =

If your theme supports Wordpress Posts Thumbnail feature and post has a specified Post Thumbnail as seen on Edit Post page, when this image will be used as a post thumbnail in related posts. The size of the image is determined by plugin setting 'Post-thumbnails name'.

If your theme does not support Post Thumbnail feature or post has no assigned thumbnail, when the first image on the post will be used as a thumbnail.

= Does plugin support external images, e.g. uploaded on Flickr? =

There is no such support in the current version of the plugin.

= What is default image URL? =

If there are no images of the specified size in the post, or file does not exist on the server the default image will be used as a post thumbnail. You can upload your image on server and specify its URL in plugin settings.
